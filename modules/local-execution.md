# Local Execution

Back in the [Hello CLI](hello-cli.md) module, we briefly mentioned that you can run webtasks locally using `wt serve`. That example was very simple, but it did not rely on 3rd party modules, secrets, or on accessing the storage APIs. In addition to running a task locally, you can also specify secrets and storage using JSON files. You'll see how in this section.

## Fetch a Local Copy of WT6

Let's start by getting a local copy of **wt6** so you can run it locally.

- Create a new file in your workshop directory, `touch wt6.js`.
- Open your browser to [https://webtask.io/edit/wt6](https://webtask.io/edit/wt6).
  - Alternatively, you can use `wt edit wt6` from the command line.
- Using your favorite text editor, copy the webtask code to the **wt6.js** file.
- Using **NPM** install the **slack-notify** module, `npm install slack-notify --save`.

## Local Secrets

To set secrets, you can provide a secrets file where each secret is a key/value pair.

- Execute the command `touch .secrets`.
- Open it in your favorite text editor.
- Add a key/value pair for the `SLACK_URL` in the following format.
- Save the file 

```
SLACK_URL={slack_url}
```

**Note:** Replace the entire token on the right hand side including curly braces.


## Local Storage

For storage you can provide a text file which will act as the store. You can also pre-populate the text file if you want to provide test data in the store.

- Execute the command `touch .storage`.

## Execute with Secrets & Storage

To serve, you'll additionally specify the secrets and storage file at the command line. Also you'll need to pass `--parse-body` to force the body to be parsed.

- Execute the following command.

```bash
wt serve --parse-body wt6.js --secrets-file .secrets --storage-file .storage
```

Now that the server is running, you can send a request. Becuase this task requires a POST with a body, you can use `curl`.

- Open a second terminal window.
- Execute the curl command below.

```bash
curl localhost:8080 -H "content-type: application/json" -d '{ 
    "action":"opened", 
    "repository":{ 
        "full_name": "Fake Repository" 
    }, 
    "issue":{ 
        "number":1, 
        "url":"github.com/fake/fake", 
        "title":"Fake Issue 1", 
        "body":"Fake Body" 
    } 
}'
```

Check the first terminal, you should see the message "issue created". Also if you check your slack channel, you'll see the dummy issue was in fact created!

## Summary

You have just learned how to execute your webtask locally using both **secrets** and **storage**. This is helpful to reduce the feedback cycle while developing. You can work locally and iterate quickly, then publish your webtask when it is done.

Next, you will learn about a couple different methods for [Local Debugging](local-debugging.md).
